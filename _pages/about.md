I'm a PhD graduate in Industrial Engineering with a focus on application of machine learning and multi-agent systems. My work applies these tools to solve real-world problems in transportation, manufacturing, and environmental research. I enjoy building practical solutions that use data and algorithms to improve how systems work. I’ll be available for full-time opportunities starting June 16, 2025.
